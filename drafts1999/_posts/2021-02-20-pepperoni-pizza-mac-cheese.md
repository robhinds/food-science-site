recipe:
  servings: 1 rack, three bone-in beef ribs (4-6 people)
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 8 - 10 hours
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 1 rack of short beef ribs (a.k.a Jacobs Ladder)
    - Yellow mustard (Frenchs/Heinz)
    - BBQ Rub (see notes for recommendations - quality salt and cracked black pepper work well here)
  directions_markdown:
    - <em>The timings of each phase can be adjusted, as per notes above. And you should test for doneness when you are unwrapping, it maybe that they are already very tender and cooked at that point.</em>
    - First step is to trim the excess fat and silverskin/membrane from the top of the rack of ribs. The top of the ribs should be visibly all meat. You do not need to trim the underside (bone side) of the ribs, or remove any membrane here.
    - Apply a light coating of yellow mustard to the ribs, top and bottom
faqSchema:
  - title: "How long should I smoke beef short ribs for?"
    answer: "Smoking beef ribs low and slow can easily take 8+ hours. Exact timing will depend on the size of the ribs, cooking temperature and other factors. You should cook by internal temperature, not time, but allow at least 8 hours for the cook (allowing longer is a safer option)"
  - title: "How to tell if beef short ribs are cooked?"
    answer: "Beef short ribs should reach an internal temperature of 96C/205F, and when probed with a temperature probe (or skewer) they should offer little resistance (they should 'probe like button')"
  - title: "What temperature should I smoke pork ribs at?"
    answer: "Beef short ribs (jacobs ladder) are best cooked low and slow between 110-135C/225-275F."
