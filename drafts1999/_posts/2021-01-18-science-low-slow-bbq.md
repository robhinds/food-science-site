Smoking and BBQ is often low-and-slow cooking, that is cooking for an extended period of time (anything from an hour through to double figures and overnight cooking) at a lower temperature, normally in the range of 110-135C (225-275F). But why these temperatures and times? Most elements of cooking (from meat transformation to food safety) are a product of time and temperature, so why do we bother cooking low-and-slow? What's so special about cooking at lower temperatures? Burning coal can, obviously, easily reach temperatures way above this range without any issue.
