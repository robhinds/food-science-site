This is the third burger in a series of recipes that I created for a cooking competition that I am currently a part of. It's specifically a BBQ competition run by Globalitc charcoal company, and the third round was themed "TV Dinners" - the idea being you had to BBQ a meal based on something from, or inspired by, a TV show or movie.

There are lots of great food references in films and TV, and I finally settled on a Die Hard themed meal (inspired by the movie rather than taken from scenes).

## Burger 3) The Nakatomi Tower burger
This one was the one that had the most thought going into it out of the three. The others were about the food, but this one is all about my nerd-y obsession to create a concept burger inspired by the film.

At first glance, it looks like a pretty regular cheeseburger. The components aren't special, and it probably looks a lot  like lots of other burgers in existence. But this is more than a burger. It's a concept. A very, very nerd-y concept.

Lets work down the stack
- First off, its a tower burger - stacked tall like the infamous Nakatomi tower where the original Die Hard movie is set
- The burger is sauced with Okonomiyaki sauce - which is a Japanese sauce that isn't too far from a regular BBQ sauce profile (very easy to make with ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, honey and soy sauce) - another nod to the Nakatomi corporations country of origin.
- Top of the burger is charred and chopped fresh chillies - these represent the explosives that Hans Gruber and his men planted in the roof of the tower
- Between the buns are layers of german sausage slices, representing Hans Gruber and his German team scattered throughout the tower
- The cheese is Swiss cheese, a nod to a famous quote from Al Powell, who shouted "THEY'RE TURNING MY CAR INTO SWISS CHEESE" when under fire

I'm not going to go into real details for the burger - its a burger, but if you want it Die Hard themed, just use some of the components above and take every opportunity to explain (in painstaking detail) to anyone and everyone!
