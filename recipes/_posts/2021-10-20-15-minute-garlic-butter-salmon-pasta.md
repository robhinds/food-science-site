how_to_description: A simple and quick (yes, really less than 15 minutes) salmon pasta dish
how_to_name: 15 minute, creamy salmon pasta dish
recipe:  
  servings: 4 people
  prep: 2 minutes
  cook: 12 minutes
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 2 fillets salmon
    - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
    - Angus&Oink Garlic butter rub (see notes)
    - 2 tablespoons plain flour
    - 125ml milk
    - Pasta of your choice
  directions_markdown:
    - Heat a knob of butter in a large frying pan or skillet
    - Once its melted and the pan is hot, add the chopped salmon
    - Liberally coat the salmon with Angus&Oink Garlic Butter rub and continue to cook (see notes)
    - Soon as the rub is applied, add your pasta of choice to a pan of boiling water and cook to instructions (probably about 10 minutes)
    - Stir the salmon, cooking it on all sides, as it cooks it will start to flake - gently stir with a wooden spoon to break apart the salmon
    - Add another knob of butter and let that melt, once the bubbling has subsided (this is the water from the butter evaporating), add a tablespoon of plain flour, stir through
    - The flour and butter should have formed a fairly thick paste (this is our roux), gently start to add the milk, stirring or whisking thoroughly with each addition, making sure its fully combined before adding more.
    - Simmer gently until the pasta is done cooking - once done, combine the pasta and creamy salmon and mix through. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the pasta water to the sauce to loosen it before adding the pasta.

I wasn't really planning on adding this _recipe_. It's so simple, its just kind of made up, but it works so well and the kids love it (its actually their favourite thing I cook, I think) so thought I would add it here.

The great thing is, not only is it really simple in terms of ingredients, it genuinely is a 15 minute meal - you can time yourself if you don't believe me! The salmon sauce is done in the time the pasta is finished cooking, and allowing a couple minutes of prep you easily get it done in 15 minutes. It's a great meal when I'm working at home with lots on but need to get the boys fed, I can work up until 16:45, have the food on the table by 17:00 and get back to work!

## What is it?
It's basically a very simple béchamel sauce that we will make in the pan that the salmon is cooked, and we spike it with a good old hit of <a href="https://angusandoink.com/" target="_blank">Angus&Oink's Garlic Butter rub</a>. I love this rub, its a great multi-purpose rub that I generally find myself throwing into most savoury dishes just to amp up the flavour a bit. It's a great go-to lazy store cupboard stable for me these days.

## Notes and substitutions
- As mentioned, this is a basic salmon and garlic infused béchamel sauce, but if you find yourself short of time (if thats possible) or just fancy something more decadent, you can replace the béchamel sauce stage of the recipe with double (heavy) cream. Simply add 300ml or so of cream to the salmon at the same point and you will have an equally delicious creamy pasta dish.
- If you don't have the Angus&Oink rub, then you can substitute it with two cloves of garlic finely diced.
- If you want to step up the decadence, a handful of grated cheddar added to the béchamel sauce and stirred through to melt just before adding the pasta will create a cheesy-salmon pasta dish. Basically turning our sauce into a classic white sauce
