recipe:
  servings: 18 cookies
  prep: 10 minutes (and resting overnight, ideally)
  cook: 12 minutes
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 170 grams butter
    - 100 grams golden granulated sugar
    - 160 grams light brown sugar
    - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
    - 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)
    - 250 grams plain flour
    - 1 large egg
    - 200 grams milk choc chips (or dark if you prefer)
  directions_markdown:
    - Cream the all the 170 grams of butter, 100 grams of golden granulated sugar and 160 grams light brown sugar - this might take 5 minutes in a standing mixer.
    - Add the 1 large egg and mix further until combined.
    - Mix together the 250 grams of flour with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda, mix through with the butter, sugar and egg.
    - Add the choc chips and mix again.
    - Portion up into balls of about 50 grams (about the size of an ice cream scoop), and store in the fridge - you will get the best results if they rest overnight, but you can skip this step and they will still be tasty
    - When ready to cook, bake at 160°C fan, or 180°C for 12 minutes, if they still look pale then cook a couple minutes longer.
    - Cool on a wire rack and keep in an airtight container once cold - If you like a little salt with your cookie, sprinkle a little over the top of the cookies whilst still warm.

Cookies are something I have long obsessed over. I have made thousands of them. Towards the end of 2019 I was introduced to an NYC style cookie from a hipster new cookie shop that arrived in London called <a href="https://creme.london/" target="_blank">Creme</a>. Setting aside that they are basically asking £40 for a packet of biscuits, they introduced me to a thicker style of cookie, still chewy like a cookie but a lot taller. I then must have baked something like 300 cookies the last three months of 2019 in an attempt to reverse-engineer the recipe.

Later, when lockdown hit early 2020, the cookie baking didn't slow down. One key takeaway that I learnt during lockdown was always have frozen cookie dough. I had several eggs to use up one day, so made several batches of cookies, and batched them up into bags of 6 dough balls and froze them. For months I kept finding cookies in the freezer and it was _amazing_! Any evening I fancied a quick sweet treat, I could just pop one or two in the oven and 10 minutes later you'd have a freshly baked cookie. Magic.

## Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies
So for all this talk of tall cookies that grabbed my attention in 2019, my ultimate cookies are always the orginal - crunchy around the edge, chewy in the middle, chocolatey and with a hit of salt (optional).

This week I went back to my original version and remembered why it was still the undefeated champion. Simple, quick and delicious. Everything you need.
