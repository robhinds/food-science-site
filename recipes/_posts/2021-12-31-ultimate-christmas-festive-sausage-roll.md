how_to_description: Festive, post-christmas sausage roll - make the most of left over sausage meat and sprouts
how_to_name: Brussel sprouts sausage roll
recipe:
  servings: 1 large sausage roll (slice and serve as canapes or snacks)
  prep: 5 minutes
  cook: 25 minutes
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 500 grams brussel sprouts, shelled and shredded
    - 500 grams sausage meat
    - A tablespoon of butter (or goose/pork fat if you have it leftover!)
    - 1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard
    - Festive chutney (or any tomato based chutney, but if you have a festive, christmas spiced chutney it will work well)
    - Ready rolled puff pastry, 320 gram sheet
    - 1 egg, whisked for glazing
  directions_markdown:
    - Melt the butter (or fat) in a cast iron skillet and once hot, add the shredded sprouts. Don't rush this step though - you want to get a nice char on some of the sprouts, so make sure you get that pan nicely hot. Because the sprouts are shredded and much smaller and flimsier, its harder to get a good char, so that first contact on the hot pan is important.
    - Cook the sprouts for 5-10 minutes untill they have caught in parts and generally nicely cooked
    - Once cooked, remove from the heat to cool for a minute. Whilst they cool, mix the teaspoon of wholegrain mustard through the sausage meat.
    - Unroll the puff pastry, and lengthways, spread out a generous layer of festive chutney
    - Mix the cooked shredded sprouts through the pork mix
    - Shape the sausage meat mix into a sausage shape and lay it on top of the chutney on the pastry
    - Paint along the edges of the pastry with the egg, fold the pastry over and seal the sausage roll. Finally glaze the pastry with the egg
    - Cook in a fan oven at 170C for 25 minutes and the pastry is golden brown.

If you embrace sprouts, they can produce lots of great meals. We don't get them much in the supermarkets here outside of December, but they are versatile and once you get used to cooking them properly (hot and charred with pork, ideally!) they are great.

This was another adhoc idea that I came up with given surplus sprouts and sausage meat that wasn't cooked Christmas day. It worked really well, as you can imagine, this is a pretty blank canvas and you can really write your own recipe here. Extra leftovers, different flavours, anything works really. Leftover, warming, comfort food - all wrapped in pastry. What more do you need to know?
