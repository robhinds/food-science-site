how_to_name: BBQ Lamb Chops
recipe:
  servings: 4 people
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 10 minues
  ingredients_markdown:
    - Lamb chops - 2-3 per person
    - 6 tablespoon olive oil
    - Salt and pepper
    - Handful of fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped
    - Handful flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped
    - 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar (you can get away with cider vinegar, or most vinegars will do to be honest)
    - 2 cloves of garlic, very vinely diced (pressed if you prefer)
    - 1 fresh chilli, finely chopped (as hot as you like)
    - Optional - a couple dashes hot sauce, my favourite here is Dr Trouble's chilli sauce
  directions_markdown:
    - Light the BBQ and setup to start out for direct cooking, if you have a cast iron griddle fit that and leave it to get nice and hot, if not, a cast iron skilled or a hevay based frying pan on the grill will be fine (of course, if you prefer to cook this inside, the same)
    - Whilst that is heating up, make the mint chimichurri - mix the 6 tablespoons of olive oil, vinegar, mint, parlsey, chilli, garlic, hot sauce and a generous pinch of salt and set aside (this is best fresh, but lamb chops are quick!)
    - Rub your lamb chops with some olive oil and generously season with salt and pepper (especially on the fat - lamb fat and salt is a magical thing)
    - Slap your lamb chops on the griddle and sear - you should hear an immediate sizzle and hiss when it hits the hot metal, if you don't hear that, the pan isn't hot enough (I'd probably take them off and let it heat up further)
    - I'd go for about 4 minutes each side, but if you prefer them a little more done then go 6-7 minutes (you can check the internal temperature with an instant read thermomenter, but because this is such a quick cook its often easier to wing it, and get used to the heat/cooking process and work out your own timings)
    - Serve the chops hot, drizzled with the mint chimichurri

Lamb always works well on the BBQ, if you ask me. If it wasn't for the fact that it was so expensive in the UK, I'd be eating a lot more of it. Thankfully, lots of BBQ cuts are _slightly_ cheaper (but still pretty flipping expensive!), shoulder, breast etc are a bit cheaper. Generally, for the quantity lamb chops are more expensive, so a bit more of a special treat, but if you find that you have some they are superb. Quick to cook, beuatifully flavourful and nice and soft if cooked properly.

The mint chimichurri was a bit of a random idea I had whilst planning the chops - I often go with a classic chimichurri with beef, so was thinking along those lines and thought why not add some mint, as that always pairs famously well with lamb. It's a super easy sauce to put together and packs a great punch of flavour - the acidity really brightening the meal.

This particular meal was after I bought half a lamb from a local farm, and having half a lamb in the freezer, I decided to start with the chops. Half lamb boxes are still expensive, but a good way to get a decent quantity of meat, assuming you have the money to pay up front and you have the freezer space to store it in the interim!
