recipe:
  servings: 2 people
  prep: 10 minutes + a couple hours, ideally overnight, to brine the chicken
  cook: 10 minutes
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 4 chicken breasts
    - Vegetable oil for deep frying
    - 300ml buttermilk
    - Flour for breading
    - Cayenne pepper
    - BBQ dry-run/seasoning of your choice
    - 4 American cheese slices
    - Sauces and condiments of your choice <a href="https://www.robbishfood.com/reviews/2020/12/10/review-metalhead-mayo/" target="_blank">(Metalhead mayo works well here!)</a>
    - Bread rolls of your choice
  directions_markdown:
    - Mix 1 tablespoon of your BBQ dry run with the buttermilk and add the chicken. Mix well so throughly coated (and ideally submerged) and seal in a tupperware in the fridge to brine (ideally overnight, but as long as you have is fine)
    - When ready to cook, mix the flour with a couple tablespoons of your BBQ rub (I used <a href="https://angusandoink.com/" target="_blank">Angus and Oink's Sweet Bacon rub</a>) and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flour and mix through
    - remove the chicken breasts from the brine, shaking off as much of the buttermilk as possible, and dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour, return it to the buttermilk, again shaking off excess before dredging a second time
    - Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy casserole dish or pan and place on direct heat on the BBQ. Wait for it to get to about 200C (check with an instant read thermometer probe)
    - Once the oil is hot, gently lower the breaded chicken pieces in and fry for about 5-10 minutes, depending on how thick you have kept the chicken breast (I like to cut mine into quite thin steaks, and they seem to cook in about 4-5 minutes), but check the internal temperature of the chicken to ensure it is fully cooked.
    - Construct the burger with two chicken patties and the cheese plus any additional condiments or sauces you like!

This is the second in a series of recipes that I created for a cooking competition that I am currently a part of. It's specifically a BBQ competition run by Globalitc charcoal company, and the third round was themed "TV Dinners" - the idea being you had to BBQ a meal based on something from, or inspired by, a TV show or movie.

There are lots of great food references in films and TV, and I finally settled on a Die Hard themed meal (inspired by the movie rather than taken from scenes).

## Burger 2) The John McClain - Yippee-cayenne motherclucker!!
A classic all American, deep fried chicken burger, in honour of the star of the film John McClain. I'd be lying if I said I didn't start with the name and work backwards to make a burger that matched up!

I was deep frying anyway, so was easy enough to brined the chicken in buttermilk in advance, and then drop them in to deep fry after the aubergine burgers.
