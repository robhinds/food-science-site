This is my go-to, ultimate Moroccan style spice mix that I have tweaked over time. I use it on <a href="https://www.robbishfood.com/recipes/kebabs/2020/10/21/fake-away-doner-kebab/" target="_blank">home made lamb doner kebabs</a>, BBQ lamb neck, lamb shoulder and a load of other bits! (but as you might tell, lamb is my favourite combo for this mix).

I have named it _Mo-Rock'n'Roll_, and honestly I'm sharing the recipe here in no small part because I love the name so much, hahah.

Applying liberally over lamb neck (as per header picture) or <a href="https://www.robbishfood.com/recipes/howto/2022/06/09/how-to-smoke-lamb-shoulder/" target="_blank">lamb shoulder</a> before smoking _low-and-slow_ is always a winner.
