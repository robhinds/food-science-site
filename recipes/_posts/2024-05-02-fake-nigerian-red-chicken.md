how_to_description: How to make my version of red stew with chicken
how_to_name: Homemade red chicken stew
recipe:
  servings: 4-6 people
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 40-60 minues
  ingredients_markdown:
    - 1 kg chicken thighs - skin-on, bone-in
    - 1 teaspoon chilli powder
    - 1 teaspoon paprika
    - 1 tablespoon oregano
    - 1 bay leaf
    - curry powder/preferred spice seasonings (optional)
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 1 red bell pepper
    - 2-3 fresh chillies (choose your type, depending on heat preference)
    - handful of fresh tomatoes (4-6 depending on size)
    - 400g can of chopped tomatoes
    - 5 cloves of garlic
    - vegetable oil
    - 250ml chicken stock (1 stock cube)
    - 1 tablespoon vegetable bouillon
    - 2 tablespoons tomato puree
  directions_markdown:
    - Light the BBQ and setup to start out for direct cooking (alternatively, if you are indoors, preheat the fan oven to 180C)
    - Over the direct heat, preheat the oil in a heavy base pan - we are going to start out by searing the skin on the chicken thighs, and we want a nice brown, crispy skin and a heavy base will help us do this. I will cook the stew in this pan, so don't use cast iron - something like an enamelled cast iron casserole dish is ideal.
    - Trim the thighs to your liking, I generally find they have too much loose skin on them.
    - Season chicken thighs with salt and any spices you fancy - the latest time I had some pre-mixed jerk chicken spice so used some of that, but this is optional. I often just use salt and pepper at this step
    - Add the chicken thighs, skin down, to the hot pan and sear the skin - 7-10 minutes. Once nicely seared flip over to cook the underside for a few minutes. Do this in batches if there isn't room in the pan - as we are searing we want to make sure the thighs have good contact with the pan
    - Remove the chicken from the pan and place in a bowl whilst we prep everything else
    - Add the chopped onion and leave to gently cook until soft and translucent
    - Put the chopped red bell pepper, fresh tomatoes, tinned tomatoes and garlic into a food processor and process until smooth
    - Once the onions are cooked, add the tomato and pepper sauce and continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes at a reasonable heat to reduce the liquid. We are aiming for it going from quite liquid to quite a think, rich looking sauce
    - Add in the tomato puree and cook for another few minutes
    - Add the herbs, spices and vegetable bouillon powder and mix through
    - Add the chicken thighs back in and stir in chicken stock - you don't need to use it all, just so the sauce is back at a fairly liquid consistency
    - Close the lid on the BBQ (if using) and adjust the vents to let the temperature settle in at around 180C. I leave this direct heat (no deflector added) but you can add it if you prefer)
    - Cover and cook put in the BBQ (or oven) for another 20-30 minutes (it can go longer if you need it to, just add water if the sauce is reducing too much) - the chicken should easily be past the safe 165F internal temperature by then (and it's fine for it to be much higher - thighs are much more resilient to higher temperatures). The sauce should almost be separating as the chicken juices blend into the sauce, give it a stir halfway through
    - Once it's done it should be a beautiful, rich red colour and a really deep, full flavour. Serve it with rice.

This is a dish I call _"Otty's mum's chicken"_. It isn't really that, though. This is a version I have had to make up in my efforts to re-create it.

I have a good friend, called Otty, and for as long as I can remember, whenever I would go to his house (seemingly any time of day, any day of the week), there was always a pot of red chicken stew in the kitchen, and it's the most magical food I've ever eaten. It got to the point whereby Otty knew I would ask about it, and would often bring it along when we met up. On one occasion, he was on a video shoot (he's a singer), he brought tubs and tubs of the stuff to feed the whole crew + cast, needless to say, it was well received.

Despite repeatedly asking, Otty never told me the recipe - he offered several times for me to go watch him make it, as it wasn't as simple as writing it down, but I never managed that, either (you know how it is, life is to busy!). Since then, I have tried googling it, and I think it his mum's variation of _Nigerian Red Stew_ (I also learnt that apparently the tradition of always having it on the side is quite commonplace too).

<br>

Anyway, between googling _Nigerian Red Stew_ and applying things I know from other recipes that produce similar textures, outcomes and gradual tweaking, this is my recipe. It's not as spicy as Otty's mum's was, largely because I have to feed it to young-ish kids who don't have a great spice tolerance (although the latest batch was _pretty_ spicy and they didn't even bat an eyelid, so its probably better than I give them credit for!)

The recipe here can be super easily cooked inside on a hob + oven, or can be done just as easily on a BBQ. If I'm cooking this outside, I use my Kamado (e.g. Big Green Egg, Kamafo Joe, Masterbuilt Kamado) as it allows for easy direct heat cooking and then easily settles in at a decent temp to cook, but a pellet BBQ (such as Traeger etc) would handle this easily.

(_Footnote: I didn't manage to get a picture for this latest cook, so the image is an AI generated image, just for fun! To be honest, its not a great image and not that life like - once I cook it next time I will try to get a better photo, I promise!_)
