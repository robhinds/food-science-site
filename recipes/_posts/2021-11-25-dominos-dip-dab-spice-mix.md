I have previously reviewed a pizza inspired <a href="https://www.robbishfood.com/reviews/2021/01/31/subwolfer-pizza-wings/" target="_blank">rub from RubWolfer called "Pizza Wings"</a> which is sadly no longer available, so this spice mix was inspired by that. Basically its a seasoning or spice mix that captures flavours of pizza.

Whilst the idea for a pizza flavour seasoning came from my enjoyment of Pizza Wings, my real goal was to create a flavour profile more like Dominos take-away pizza. I enjoy Dominos pizza, their "Meateor" pizza with the classic tomato sauce is my go to pizza from them, and this is what this is going for.

It's a pretty simple mix, and really doesn't take many ingredients. If you have eaten Dominos, you will know they are very salt heavy (to the point of leaving you feeling rubbish the next day if you eat too much, I often find if I over-indulge I will be up in the night de-hydrated and thirsty and suffering from a _Dominos Hangover_ the next day). Aside from the salt, we use dried tomato powder, garlic and oregano for the classic pizza base flavour and then just a pinch of ground fennel seeds. The fennel might seem like a bit of a curve ball, but fennel has long featured in Italian meats and sausage (fennel and pork is a great combo). Dominos keep that pairing with their pork meatballs on the Meateor, and it works here too.

Once you have made the mix, taste a dab of it, and I swear your mouth will feel like its just eaten a Dominos pizza!
